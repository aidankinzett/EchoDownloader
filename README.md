# EchoDownloader
EchoDownloader checks multiple echo360 lecture recording RSS feeds, downloads any new lectures, then renames and sorts them into subject folders. Requires "vodcast" RSS feed url, found at the bottom of the subject's echo360 page. Run the script regularly, such as on a crontab, to keep the downloads up to date.

Currently the downloaded videos are in a very low resolution, a high resolution downloader is in development.
